# Canvas Bot

## What is this?
A splash-command-supported Discord bot built with [hikari](https://www.hikari-py.dev/) and [lightbulb](https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to bring data from De Anza Canvas to the Discord platform. The purpose of the bot is to serve a course's Discord server and provides relevant course-wise information to all students in that course through Discord. 

In the future, the bot may be tweaked to become more user-oriented, or that will be made into a separate project.
